## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), pursuing a minor in Robotics, with a deep interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and environmental systems. My work bridges software engineering, data science, and sustainabilityâ€”integrating computational modeling with real-world applications.

Currently, I serve as a Frontend Developer at Martrio, a Washington-based technology startup, where I focus on designing and implementing intuitive, high-performance web interfaces. Using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, I develop responsive and scalable front-end architectures that prioritize accessibility, design consistency, and user experience. I also collaborate on authentication systems, dashboard modules, and API integrations, applying clean Git workflows and modern UI/UX principles to ensure efficient development pipelines.

At Caltechâ€™s Orphan Laboratory, I am conducting research on the directed selection of algal populations for enhanced carbon sequestration efficiency. My work involves constructing a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to analyze Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and DNA sequencing datasets. I am currently focusing on implementing Random Forest models to uncover predictive relationships between environmental conditions and algal productivity. This research, funded by the Kiyo and Eiko Tomiyasu SURF Scholarship, combines my interests in machine learning, sustainability, and bioinformaticsâ€”demonstrating how computational methods can inform ecological innovation.

Academically, I am strengthening my foundation in both theoretical and applied computer science through coursework such as ME129 (Experimental Robotics), CS156 (Learning from Data), ACM104 (Applied Linear Algebra), Ma6 (Discrete Mathematics), and CS12 (Fundamentals of Computer Programming). These courses have allowed me to develop a strong background in algorithmic reasoning, robotics systems, and data-driven modeling while applying these skills in hands-on research and engineering contexts.

Previously, I conducted neurobiological research under Professor Jagmeet S. Kanwal at Georgetown University, where I utilized machine learning algorithms such as ToxTrac and ImageJ to analyze navigational decision-making in ants. I have also contributed to mechanical design and engineering at Twin Science, where I helped improve cost-efficiency and functionality of educational robotics sensors.

Beyond academia and industry, I have been recognized internationally for my commitment to innovation and sustainability. As a Rise Global Winner, I developed a hydrogen sulfide mitigation system designed to reduce water toxicity in sewage systems. My initiatives have also been acknowledged by NASA International Space Apps Challenge, The Earth Prize, and the Chegg Global Student Prize, where I was a Top 50 finalist.

My long-term goal is to advance the fields of machine learning and robotics through interdisciplinary research that connects intelligent computation with sustainable environmental applications. I aim to develop technologies that both extend human capability and contribute to a more sustainable future.
