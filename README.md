## Hi there 👋

👋 I’m Efe Sakarya, a Computer Science student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) minoring in Robotics. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that combine machine learning, robotics, and sustainability to solve complex, real-world problems.

💻 As a Frontend Developer at Martrio, I design and build scalable, production-ready web applications using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI. My focus lies in performance optimization, authentication flows, and API integration — ensuring responsive, user-centered interfaces and clean, maintainable codebases.

🧠 At Caltech’s Orphan Lab, I develop a machine learning pipeline for analyzing Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and DNA sequencing data. Using Random Forest regression, I model relationships between environmental conditions and algal productivity to optimize carbon sequestration efficiency — research supported by the Kiyo and Eiko Tomiyasu SURF Scholarship.

🎓 My coursework includes Experimental Robotics (ME/CS/EE 129), Learning from Data (CS 156), Applied Linear Algebra (ACM 104), and Discrete Mathematics (Ma 6) — providing a strong foundation in algorithms, systems, and statistical modeling.

🔬 Previously, I researched ant navigation and neurobiological decision-making at Georgetown University using ImageJ and ToxTrac, and gained hardware design experience at Twin Science, optimizing sensors for educational robotics kits.

🌍 Recognized as a Rise Global Winner, I developed a hydrogen sulfide mitigation system to reduce water toxicity, and my work has been acknowledged by NASA Space Apps Challenge, The Earth Prize, and the Chegg Global Student Prize.

🚀 I aim to bridge AI, robotics, and environmental technology — creating intelligent systems that drive both innovation and sustainability.
